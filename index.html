<h1>Causes of Death In NYC 2007-2011</h1>
<a href="NYCLeadingCausesofDeath.xlsx">Causes of Death In NYC from 2007-2011 Data</a>
<p>My data set includes the leading causes of death in New York City from 2007 to 2011. From this data I wanted to find out if the deaths caused by pregnancy or child labor in New York City increased or decreased over the years. First, I made a pivot table with the years as my columns, causes of death as my rows, and count as my values. I then sorted the cause of death by pregnancy and child labor, and changed the count to a sum. From these results I found that there were 68 pregnancy/child labor deaths in 2007, which then increased to 72 in 2008 (the peak). It decreased in 2011 to only 50 deaths, which is a 31% decrease from 2008. As a journalist, I would examine possible reasons as to why the deaths are decreasing, including legislative reform or technological advances. </p>
