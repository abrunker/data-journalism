  <div class="article">
<p>New York City is coined the city that never sleeps, and who has time for sleep in a metropolis that has 24-hour food delivery service, nightclubs and concerts that keep the music pumping into the early hours of the morning, and construction sites that get a jumpstart on their projects in what seems like the middle of the night? Your apartment may seem like the only retreat, but when a neighbor's dog starts barking to be let out for its morning walk or a loud party starts down the hall, it may feel like there is no place to escape the constant pounding of the city streets, prompting many New Yorkers to call the non-emergency 311-hotline and file a complaint.</p>

<p>With more than 143,000 noise complaints made to the 311-service this past year, noise pollution remains the number one quality of life issue in New York City. So, we were curious to find out where all this noise was coming from, breaking the number of complaints down by each New York City zip code per 1,000 people.</p><div id="headerBar"></div>

<h2>The Top Three Noisiest Neighborhoods</h2>

<h4>1. Hell's Kitchen</h4>
<p>Located near the hub of Times Square, it comes as no surprise that Hell's Kitchen takes the number one spot of noisiest neighborhood in New York City. Residents filed a total of 635 complaints in a year, which comes down to approximately 1 complaint per every 10 people.  Thirty-six percent of those complaints were due to loud music and parties, but construction noise came in a close second at 31 percent. What used to be an area known for its gritty appearance and low rent prices is now gentrifying at a rapid pace, which explains all of the construction noise complaints. On a recent Saturday evening, the hum of drills and loud bangs of sledgehammers filled 8th Avenue in the upper West 30's. And outside these construction sites were images of what the completed project would be in 2015, and in almost every instance it was a luxury residential building. Real estate agent Sebastian Lopera estimates that this construction will continue for the next decade. "Hell's Kitchen is growing at a rapid pace," said Lopera. "Developers are buying buildings here on the cheap and are turning them into luxury condos with high price tags." </p>

<h4>2. Govenors Island</h4>
<p>The 172-acre island is home to only a little over 3,000 New Yorkers, who filed a total of 308 complaints last year or 1 complaint for every 10 people. The majority of these complaints were due to construction (40 percent), and other notable sources came from loud talking (17 percent) and music (12 percent). In 2012, Governors Island began a 30-acre development project to be called Governors Island Park, and the park won't be finished until 2015. The parkland project will feature varying levels of elevation to maximize views of the harbor and the Statue of Liberty surrounded by dozens of red hammocks, as well as new hedges and gardens. This type of project is bound to cause plenty of noise, but in the end may be worth it for its residents.</p> 

<p>Although Governors Island may be small, it hosts many concerts in the summer months. And it's probably no coincidence that of all the loud music complaints filed in Governors Island, 69 percent of those complaints occurred in the summer months when the majority of the concerts were happening on the beach and in nearby clubs and bars. Here are some of the biggest events of the summer:</p>

<h4>3. Battery Park</h4>
<p>Out of the 270 complaints filed, 62 percent were because of construction noise. And its close proximity to Governors Island may partly explain why. But over the past year, Battery Park has undergone its own renovations due the boom people moving downtown. "The noise is pretty much constant," said a resident of the fairly new apartment complex 90 John Street of the building of new luxury rentals across the street. "Even on weekends you hear sledgehammers start pounding at 7 a.m."</p>

<p>If you're looking for some peace and quiet, reside in the neighborhoods of <strong>Pelham Bay Park, New Hyde Park, or Rockaway Point.</strong>
These three zip codes had nearly zero noise complaints per 1,000 people through the year.</p>

    <p>The top five noises New Yorkers report are loud music and parties, construction, loud talking, car music, and barking dogs. But each neighborhood has its vice. Washington Heights contains the loudest partiers and car music, Hell's Kitchen has the most construction complaints, Norwood in the Bronx has the loudest talkers, and Bushwick houses all the yipping dogs.</p>
