<h1>Final Pitch</h1>
<p>New York City is known as the city that never sleeps, and some New Yorkers aren't happy about it - just ask the non-emergency services. Noise complaints are a commonality in the city as one of the leading complaints sent through to 311. Officers attempt to respond to these issues when they aren't responding to emergency situations, but given the vast number of noise complaints (over 600 last Saturday alone), there don't seem to be enough officers to check in on all of them. Since 311 isn't the most efficient way to avoid noise pollution, I would like to discover what area of NYC experiences the fewest amount of noise complaints and what areas experience the most.</p>

<p>To discover this answer, I would utilize NYC.gov's ample database that provides up-to-date results from the 311 service, as well as precise degrees longitude and latitude as to where the noise is coming from. I plan to look at <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9">the amount of noise complaints in the past year</a> and sort that data based on zip code, as well as the type of noise complaint (i.e. loud party, television). From there, I would create a heat map that would display the amount of noise complaints by zip code. I would also like to make the map interactive as to allow users to sort based on type of noise complaint.</p>

<p>I would also like to gain expert perspective on noise complaints in the city by speaking to a few people in the NYPD. I believe interviewing an officer in an area with a lot of complaints and an officer in an area with limited complaints would give law enforcement's view on 311 reports. Also, I would like to interview those living in the loudest and quietest areas of the city (based on total complaints).</p>

<p>Since the project would require a significant amount of data being updated often, I would need to learn how to create a script that keeps the data set up to date. Furthermore, I need to learn how to build out an interactive map (heat map in particular). The project would be a good fit for New York Magazine, Gothamist, or another NYC-based publication.</p>
