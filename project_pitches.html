<h1>Data Visualization Project Pitches</h1>

<p><strong>Pitch One</strong></p>
<p>Kale has garnered a lot of popularity over recent years as the latest booming food trend. From smoothies to salads, the superfood has quickly become a staple of health enthusiasts from New York to LA. But where does it come from in the United States, and how are farmers catering domestically to the demand?</p>

<p>My project would take a closer look at <a href="http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/9D4C0A81-FF8C-362B-8CC5-EE07EDA05D7A?long_desc__LIKE=kale#014F11A0-3BB9-3D69-962C-0D138C39BBFC">kale growth (in acres) in the United States by county</a>. I would build an interactive map that displayed growth in the years 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012. The project would allow me to see the rise in acres dedicated to kale farming in the US, as well as what climates seem to be the most welcoming to kale and what regions have seen the greatest adoption. I could also develop a chart comparing kale farming to other leafy green farming in the United States, such as spinach and romaine.</p>

<p>In order to gain a bit more insight on the kale craze, I would like to interview Dr. Drew Ramsey, who on Oct. 1 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/drew-ramsey-md/kale_b_5909244.html">wrote an article for the Huffington Post on National Kale Day</a>, would reveal the benefits of kale and add thoughts on its growing acceptance. Meanwhile, speaking to <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/pandp/people/people.htm?personid=21748">Ignatius Murph</a> at the US Dept of Agriculture would allow me to gather insights on how farming kale is trending in the overall agricultural industry. Ignatius is based in Georgia, which is an area where kale farming is relatively common. Lastly, Jacob Grant of Roots Organic Farm in Southern California would be another potential source of insight. Southern California is a leading grower of kale, and Grant has a history with the plant, even <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/23/food/la-fo-marketwatch-20111223">speaking about it to the LA Times</a> back in 2011. </p>

<p>To see this project come to fruition, I would need to learn how to create an interactive map that shows data change of time periods (i.e. kale growth in 1998 vs. 2002 vs. 2007 vs. 2012). Since the data sets are not incredibly large, I should be able to download these without much issue. </p>

<p>Lastly, in terms of where this could be pitched, I believe the project would be a good fit for <i>Modern Farmer</i>, while <i>New York</i> is another option, considering the large acceptance of kale in NYC. </p>

<p><strong>Pitch Two</strong></p>
<p>New York City is known as the city that never sleeps, and some New Yorkers aren't happy about it - just ask the non-emergency services. Noise complaints are a commonality in the city as one of the leading complaints sent through to 311. Officers attempt to respond to these issues when they aren't responding to emergency situations, but given the vast number of noise complaints (over 600 last Saturday alone), there don't seem to be enough officers to check in on all of them. Since 311 isn't the most efficient way to avoid noise pollution, I would like to discover what area of NYC experiences the fewest amount of noise complaints and what areas experience the most.</p>

<p>To discover this answer, I would utilize NYC.gov's ample database that provides up-to-date results from the 311 service. I plan to look at <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9">the amount of noise complaints in the past year</a> and sort that data based on zip code, as well as the type of noise complaint (i.e. loud party, television). From there, I would create a heat map that would display the amount of noise complaints by zip code. I would also like to make the map interactive as to allow users to sort based on type of noise complaint.</p>

<p>I would also like to gain expert perspective on noise complaints in the city by speaking to a few people in the NYPD. I believe interviewing an officer in an area with a lot of complaints and an officer in an area with limited complaints would give law enforcement's view on 311 reports. Also, I would like to interview those living in the loudest and quietest areas of the city (based on total complaints).</p>

<p>Since the project would require a significant amount of data being updated often, I would need to learn how to create a script that keeps the data set up to date. Furthermore, I need to learn how to build out an interactive map (heat map in particular). The project would be a good fit for New York Magazine, Gothamist, or another NYC-based publication.</p>

<p><strong>Pitch Three</strong></p>
<p>Antidepressants have long been linked to suicidal risk, and in the 1990's, the public concern over selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as Prozac) began to rise. The question: are these antidepressants doing more harm than good? Since the scare, the FDA instituted a new requirement called Black Box Warnings which point to an increase in suicide rate among children and adolescents. While the younger demographics do experience negative effects from antidepressant use, I'm curious in discovering how adults react to the medication. Most importantly, do SSRIs actually decrease suicide risk in adults? </p>

<p>I would like to create several different charts <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db76_tables.pdf">breaking down antidepressant use based on demographic</a>, and then compare suicide rates in those demographics. According to the CDC, antidepressant prescriptions <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db76.htm#findings">increased over 400%</a> during the years 1988-1994 and 2004-2008, and I'd like to display that huge uptick visually. Furthermore, I am considering creating a chart based on the findings of the study <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/content/180/3/291.short">"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Risk of Suicide: A Systematic Review of Observational Studies,"</a> published in 2009 and focusing wholly on the effects of antidepressants on suicidal tendencies in children, young adults, adults, and geriatrics. </p>

<p>To give the project more credibility, I would like to speak to Shannon Carroll, a psychiatrist at NYU, to discuss the effects of antidepressants, both negative and positive. Furthermore, I would like to reach out to Dr. Corrado Barbui, who conducted the aforementioned study on antidepressants and suicidal tendencies.  

<p>In order to complete this project, I would need to focus heavily on learning how to create visually engaging, but clear infographics utilizing Adobe Creative Suite (InDesign, PS, etc.). Since these would not be interactive to the user, I would like to learn how to include annotations on certain data points to provide more insight to the user. This project could be published in Psychology Today (or another psychology publication), or TIME, a publication focused on current events such as depression, a perennial issue. </p>
